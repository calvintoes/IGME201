#Hogwarts Student Database

Using the "test.json" file, which comprised of a list of Student attributes: Date of Births, Detentions, 
HasHogsmeadePermissionForm, House, Name, Subjects, and Year level, it would be inputed and read into the program. 
The program should keep a database of the students and be able to add, delete, or edit the students.

The data would be displayed in the appropriate GUIs.

New User - will create a new student given the user input. (I haven't gotten the data to save)

Edit User - allows user to edit the chosen student (I haven't been able to get the data to save either)
